`remove-unplayable-songs` is a [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) extension that allows you to quickly remove every unplayable/greyed out songs in your playlist.

## How to use it?

To remove unplayable songs from a playlist, simply right click on one of your playlists and click on `Remove unplayable songs`.  
To remove unplayable songs from your liked songs, right click on the `Liked Songs` button on your sidebar, the one you have by default,  then click on the button that appears in the popup.

## Notes

I didn't find a way to only show the option on playlists where you have the remove permission (so basically your playlists).  
When attempting to remove unplayable songs in a playlist where you don't have sufficient permissions it won't do anything and will simply display a message to tell you why it failed.
