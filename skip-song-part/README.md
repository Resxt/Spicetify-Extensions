`skip-song-part` is a [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) extension that makes it possible to skip any part you don't want to hear in any song.  
It allows you to define segments in a song you're currently listening to to always skip this/these part(s) of this song whenever it's playing again.

## Why use this?

It can be useful if there are songs that you listen to that have some part(s) you find bad/useless/annoying/empty etc.  
Here are some use cases from my personal experience:

- Songs with long dialogues ([example 1 from 00:00 to 00:55](https://open.spotify.com/track/7EsjkelQuoUlJXEw7SeVV4?si=17c1664358e24066) | [example 2 from 03:00 to 03:34](https://open.spotify.com/track/10uGdDVJHS0Pgwx1T2U4kH?si=6ec6f01dbdab4aab))
- Songs that feature an artist you don't like
- Songs with long and almost silent beginnings/endings
- Songs that have a really loud/annoying noise at a certain moment

## How to use it?

### Adding a segment

When listening to a song that contains the part(s) you want to skip, do the following:

- Go to the beginning of the moment you want to skip and pause the song
- Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to start creating a segment
- Play the song again, find the end of the part you want to skip and pause the song
- Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> again to save the segment

### Deleting a segment

- Click on your profile picture in the Spotify app
- Click on `Skip song part menu`
- Click on a segment to delete it or click on a song to delete all the segments this song has

You can also click on the `Delete all segments` button at the bottom to delete every single segment from every song.  
If you want to keep some segments, delete the ones you don't want one by one instead.

## Notes

For now this only works after you change to another song.  
So when testing your newly created segments you need to change to another song and come back to the one you created segments for.
