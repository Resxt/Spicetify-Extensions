`full-queue-clear` is a [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) extension that makes it possible to completely clear the queue.  
Whenever you click the corresponding button your queue will be completely empty and you won't have any song playing anymore.  
Essentially this a one click fresh start/reset for your queue.

## Why use this?

I created this because I want to listen exactly what I want in the order that I want.  
The way Spotify handles the queue with tracks coming from "context" (you clicking play on a playlist) and "queue" (you clicking on "add to queue") isn't ideal in my opinion.  
I would rather just clear up the queue and add the playlists/tracks I want and only listen to that without having my context playlist being mixed up with my actual queue.  

This can also be useful if you're a design maniac who wants a clean bar when you're not listening to anything or for screenshots.

## How to use it?

Simply right click the queue icon in your playbar (the area with the volume, lyrics, fullscreen button etc)
