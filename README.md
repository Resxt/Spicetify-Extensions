# startup-page

`startup-page` is a [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) extension that does exactly what it says.  
Whenever you start Spotify it will go to your preferred startup page instead of the home page.

## Supported pages
- Home
- Search
- LibraryPlaylists
- LibraryPodcasts
- LibraryArtists
- LibraryAlbums
- LikedSongs
- Marketplace

## Configuration
By default `startup-page` does nothing since it's configured to start on the home page.  
To configure your startup page follow these simple instructions: 
- Click on your profile picture in the Spotify app
- Hover the `Startup page` submenu
- Click on your preferred startup page
