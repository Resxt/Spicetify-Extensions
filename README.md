# startup-page

`startup-page` is a [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) extension that does exactly what it says.  
Whenever you start Spotify it will go to your selected startup page instead of the home page.

## Supported pages
Every page should work.  
Here are the pages that were tested:  
- Home
- Search
- Library Playlists
- Library Podcasts
- Library Artists
- Library Albums
- Liked Songs
- Marketplace
- Artist
- Playlist
- Folder
- Album

## Configuration
By default `startup-page` does nothing since it's configured to start on the home page.  
To configure your startup page follow these simple instructions:
- Go on the page you want to set as your startup page
- Click on your profile picture in the Spotify app
- Click on `Set startup page`
